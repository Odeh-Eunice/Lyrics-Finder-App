# Lyrics-Finder-App
A stripped-down clone of the Genius website, with only the feature to search for lyrics
through the user querying a song title or artist name.

Implemented with React, Parcel.js, and ExpressJS and uses the Genius API to fetch all of the song data.

NPM Commands:
- npm run dev: runs the express server and client in watch mode at http://localhost:3000
- npm run build: builds the client in production mode to the /dist folder
- npm start: calls npm run build and then starts the built production server
